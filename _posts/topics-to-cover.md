To start with this site, I think the best thing to do would be to list the topic ideas I think I could write about. There are some long-form tutorials, some short-form intros and guides as well as some conceptual and design topics.

The first posts I would like to cover are the abstract concepts. These would give me a good baseline of posts on the site and also test my understanding of the topics.

Here is a list of ideas I could write about:

## Long Form

- Level 4 software engineering journey
- Spring security
- Spring rest endpoints
- General HTTP/REST in Java
- Spring JWT setup
- Image compression service
- AWS/minio storage
- Docker basics
- Deploying a Java app in docker
- Setting up a Jenkins pipeline for a Java maven application

---

## Short Form

- IntelliJ shortcuts
- Maven POM file explained
- Using spring intilaizer

---

## Concept topics

- SOLID
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Containerization
- JVM
- Functional vs OO
