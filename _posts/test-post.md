First test post using markdown to build a simple blog site. Goal is to get the site up and running as fast as possible and start putting together some posts to provide some content that can show off what I know and my experience.

`here is some code, how is this rendered?`

Here is a list of ideas I could write about:

**Long Form**

- Level 4 software engineering journey
- Spring security
- Spring rest endpoints
- General HTTP/REST in Java
- Spring JWT setup
- Image compression service
- AWS/minio storage
- Docker basics
- Deploying a Java app in docker
- Setting up a Jenkins pipeline for a Java maven application

---

**Short Form**

- IntelliJ shortcuts
- Maven POM file explained
- Using spring intilaizer

---

**Ordered List**

1. Number one
2. Number one
3. Number one

| Syntax    | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Header    | Title       |
| Paragraph | Text        |
