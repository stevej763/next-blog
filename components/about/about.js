        My name is Steve Jones, I am a software developer based in the UK. My
        journey into the software development world started in 2019 when I began
        learning Python on a Raspberry Pi while studying for my teaching degree.
        By the time I graduated in 2020, my interest in coding and the endless
        possibilities it provides for solving problems and simplifying peoples
        lives had eclipsed my interest in teaching. So began my search for an
        entry level role.

        At the end of 2020 I secured my current role working for the Department
        for Work and Pensions. In this role I work as a backend software
        engineer mainly using Java. Since starting this job, my passion and
        ability for the subject has grown exponentially. I am always learning
        something new and always looking to develop myself.

        That is where this site comes in. While I love to learn new skills and
        technologies, I have a tendency to move on so quickly that I can forget
        all the topics I have covered. Here I intend to write about the subjects
        I enjoy, keeping a log of them and also sharing them with others.
