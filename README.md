# Blog site

## A statically generate blog site built using NextJs.

Having gone through about 3-4 iterations of building my own personal website from scratch before getting distracted by another interest and leaving the project half done, I decided to find a happy middle ground.

This isn't wordpress or squarespace or some other no-code website generator, it requires writing code and implementing changes, but I did start off by using a [blog template](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) provided by NextJs.

The benefits of this were that it has allowed me to skip over a lot of the configuration and set up work to get a Java application up and running (which I do enjoy) and instead focus on what content I want to make to share on the site.

I of course will be further customising or rewrite the app as I see fit, but because of the initial template I will have a working website running that I can post right away.
